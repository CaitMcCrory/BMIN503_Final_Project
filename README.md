# BMIN503/EPID600 Final Project: A Case Study - Chlamydia Incidence in Chicago 2000-2014

Due to a rise in chlamydia infections over the past decade, the importance of routine sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing has been emphasized (CDC, 2021b). Access to healthcare facilities may deter some folks from receiving routine tests. Using publicly available data through the City of Chicago, we will be analyzing the chlamydia rates across the cities neighborhoods, time, and sex to see if there is an association between these factors and chlamydia incidence.
